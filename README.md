# Topological semantics for intuitionistic modalities

This project formalises a generalised Hilbert calculus and an interior preorder semantics
for the intuitionistic modal logic iS4.

## Building
Compiling the project requires Coq version 8.18.0 and may not compile on other versions. One may enforce this locally by running
`opam pin coq 8.18.0` in the project folder.

### Instruction

The proof library compiles with `make all`.
The documentation builds with `make doc`.
